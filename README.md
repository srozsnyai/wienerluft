# Wiener Luft
This project is for educational purposes. The aim is to demonstrate how to build an end-to-end data integration pipeline incl. a public web facing page with close to zero costs.
As a side effect it allows to monitor & analyze Vienna's air quality metrics.  

The data source of this project is provided by Stadt Wien â€“ [data.wien.gv.at](https://data.wien.gv.at/)

**See deployed example:** [www.wienerluft.at](http://www.wienerluft.at)

## Architecture
![Architecture](resources/architecture.png)

#### Data Pipeline
The Cloud Scheduler emits every 15min a a pub/sub message to trigger the execution of a Cloud Function. The Cloud Function runs a Java-based application which calls the Stadt Wien API. This API returns the current readings from all the AQ stations. The cloud function parses the returned message and writes them into a BQ table in their raw format (i.e. tabular but untyped). 

#### Storage & Analytics
A BQ view is used to type the individual attributes that have been previously stored as simple string values.
